# SteveKunG - Wasinthorn Suksri

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on More Planets, and maybe some other projects.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning Java (I mean, basic java...), Algorithm, Performance and Optimization.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on Galacticraft Project and Mojang Studio. That's my dream.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I learned Java because of Minecraft Modding, It's my first programming language, seems weird right? Not gonna lie I haven't know any basic programming before. Just only do something about RA2 modding from Thai Forum when I was 12 years old. That's it.
