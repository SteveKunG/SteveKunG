## ✨ About me
Hi, My real name is Wasinthorn Suksri, my nick name is Best. I'm currently 26 years old.

## Who am I?
I'm a Java programming enjoyer for more than ten years, especially for Minecraft Modding.
And now I'm a Java Software Engineer at the Transtron Co,. Ltd.

## How did I get here?
When I was 12, I love to play games that matched my own liking. Such as Red Alert 2, Tiberian Sun, Warcraft, GTA or any popular games that exists in that era.
But the most impacted and inspiring me to start learning how to modding are Red Alert 2 and Tiberian Sun. I don't have any basic programming language before, just searching through the website and found ThaiGaming.com forum.
That website has modding resources to start with, even I don't understand the most of it but I can make it. For some unknown reason haha.
Then I met friends who plays Minecraft, and saw a mod that brings you to the space. Galacticraft.
I'm doing the same like previous games and wonder if there are modding tutorials for Minecraft, and made by Thai people. Unfortunately, no ones do it.
But somehow I found tutorials using MCreator which I made a very simple mod from it, and digging through the generated code and modifying them without know how Java works.
That's the beginning of learning Java programming by myself for more than ten years, through the passion of just wanted to make Minecraft mods.
And today, I'm still doing it!

- 🔭 I'm currently working on More Planets, and maybe some other projects.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Java (I mean, basic java...), Algorithm, Performance and Optimization.
- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on Galacticraft Project and Mojang Studio. That's my dream.

## ⚡ Fun fact
I learned Java because of Minecraft Modding, It's my first programming language, sounds weird right? Not gonna lie I haven't know or learning any basic programming before. Just only do something about Red Alert 2 modding from Thai Forum when I was 12 years old. That's it.
