## 💡 How did I get here?

When I was 12, I love to play games that matched my own liking. Such as Red Alert 2, Tiberian Sun, Warcraft, GTA or any popular games that exists in the era.

But the most impacted and inspiring me to start learning how to mod are Red Alert 2 and Tiberian Sun. I don't have any basic programming language before, just searching through the website and found ThaiGaming.com forum.

That website has modding resources to start with, even I don't understand the most of it, but I can make it. For some unknown reason haha.
Then I met friends who play Minecraft, and saw a mod that brings you to the space. Galacticraft.

I'm doing the same as previous games and wonder if there are modding tutorials for Minecraft, and made by Thai people. Unfortunately, no ones do it.

But somehow I found tutorials using MCreator which I made a very simple mod from it, and digging through the generated code and modifying them without know how Java works.

That's the beginning of learning Java programming by myself for more than ten years, through the passion of just wanted to make Minecraft mods.
And today, I'm still doing it!

### 🔊 How did I get this name?
SteveKunG is come from when I started making a YouTube channel, but previously it is MCCommander → SteveMCCommander (What a cringe name 😶‍🌫️)

Let's break down my channel names.

MCCommander - MC = Minecraft, Commander = I've heard this a lot when playing RTS. This is definitely me who is decent at Minecraft (Technical side such as Map Making, Command Blocks).

SteveMCCommander - Steve = My house didn't have internet on that time, so my skin is always Steve. So I just put them in front of previous name, that's it.

SteveKunG - Same reason as above. KunG = Most Thai Minecraft YouTubers on the 2010-2014 eras they mostly put "KunG" or "Kung" at the end of name. Just because it sounds cute. And a letter 'G' is an uppercase because it looks cool.
